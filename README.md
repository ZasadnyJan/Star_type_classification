# Star Type Classification & Exploratory Data Analysis

This notebook contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis** of the [Star Type Classification / NASA Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/brsdincer/star-type-classification) and a **RandomForestClassifier** model for prediction of star types.

## The dataset

The [Star Type Classification / NASA Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/brsdincer/star-type-classification) contains various information about stars, such as their tempearture, colour or radius. This data can be used for training classification and regression models.

## Objectives

The main objective of this notebook is to explore all of the variables contained in the dataset and present relevant observations.
Afterwards, I will perform feature engineering in order to transform the data into a form suitable for the RandomForestClassifier. Lastly, I will train the classifier to **predict Star Types** and analyse the results.
